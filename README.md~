# steamcmddl
Download windows versions of Steam Games on linux!

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Dependencies
* `dialog`
* `wget`
* Whilst not yet required, those on Xenial Xenus will require `steamcmd` in the near future.

## How to install.
1. Install all dependencies using your distributions package manager. Those that have a distribution that doesn't have steamcmd installed, look at the trusty-wily branch instead for your script.
2. Copy the file in `usr/bin` in this repository to `/usr/bin`.
=======
This version is designed for versions going up to 15.10. Those on Xenial Xerus have the `steamcmd` package already in the official repositories and should use the `master` branch instead.
